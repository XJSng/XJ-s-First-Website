        <h2 id="The first article">The &lt;article&gt; & &lt;/article&gt; elements</h2>
        <p>
          This first article has also been wrapped under the &lt;header&gt; &
          &lt;/header&gt; elements to show that this is the header of the
          article

      <p>
        This whole article (including the title) has been wrapped under the
        &lt;article&gt; & &lt;/article&gt; element. I have structured this page
        with three articles to demonstrate how semantics is used behind the
        scenes of a website to give it organisational structure. You might not
        be able to see it on the frontend but the use of hidden structure tags
        are at work.

        <h2 id="The second article">The Second Article Example</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        This second article has the &lt;header&gt;, &lt;/header&gt;,
        &lt;article&gt; & &lt;/article&gt; elements to seperate it from the first
        article. Again, the user is unable to see it on the frontend but it is
        useful for the developer reading this in code. Articles can be thought of as self-contained item of content.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <h3>Sub Article</h3>
        <p>
          This is a subarticle. You can think of it as a child to the second
          article example above. It has been give the the &lt;aside&gt; &
          &lt;/aside&gt;
        </p>
      </aside>
    </article>
  </body>

  <aside>
    <h3>This is the &lt;aside&gt; element</h3>
    <p>
      This is a stand alone aisde element. This means that this section should
      contain content about the website as a whole.
    </p>

      <h2 id="The third article">The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="article body">
    <p>
      This third article talks about the &lt;div&gt;, &lt;/div&gt;,
      &lt;span&gt; & &lt;/span&gt; elements which does not add any semantic meaning to the code but is useful for styling with CSS. The &lt;div&gt; element stands for "Division/Section" and is used for general purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then there is &lt;span&gt; which is a non-sementic element. Basically, it can use the &lt;span&gt; element to stylise with CSS in a later date.

        <p>
          This fourth article talks about how to comment on HTML. This is done by using the &lt;&excl;&ndash; &ndash; insert comment &ndash; &ndash;&gt;. Comments are useful between developers working on the code to denote changes or purpose of this line of code. It is good practice to have a comment after a &lt;/div&gt; ends.</p>
        <!--This is an example of a comment in the website code-->

    <h2 id="The fifth article">Sections in HTML</h2>
    <p>
        Sections are like chapters of a book while articles are like individual blog post with its own self-contained chapters or sections. This also means that sections can be within another sections or <em>sub-sections</em>. Something to note is that heading within a section are of the same size and will look the same heading size.
