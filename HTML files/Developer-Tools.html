      <p>
        In every modern web browser, you can right click the page to find the
        "inspect" element. You will be able to modify your website without affecting the frontend code. However, that also means that you can see the real-time changes on each individual element and know which to target when you want to make changes in your code. The inspector also allows you to trace down whether a property is targeted specifically in CSS or trickled down from a parent element.
